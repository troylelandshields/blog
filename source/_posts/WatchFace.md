Microsoft's HoloLens, slated to be released sometime this year, has some lofty ambitions. The video sells the <i>idea</i> of HoloLens incredibly well, so I don't need to -- but I'm going to anyways because it is <b>so awesome!!!</b>

The Minecraft part literally blew my mind (and the wall). The Lego execs are rightly freaking out right about now.

Imagine the video games that can be created! [LARPing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7bYxNfINmA) just got a helluva lot cooler. First-person shooters just got a helluva lot more first-persony. And board games just got a hulluva a lot less boring. And they all got more expensive!

Also, for some reason I just love the idea of downloading some 3-D object and leaving it on the table for my wife to see sitting there 3 hours later when she puts on her HoloLens. (I can't think of any practical application for this, but I don't really have to for it to be cool). (Digital Geocaching, bam just thought of one).

Microsoft announced this at a prime time. [Google Glass was just pulled off the market](http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/288727711.html), indicating to some people that Google is giving up on the HUD device taking off (I don't think we've seen the last of Glass, but in its current state I think it would always remain a niche product). It is pretty universally agreed that Google Glass is still not the success we were all hoping it would be when we watched its [concept video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R1snVxGNVs) a few years ago.

As you can see by comparing the two videos, Glass had much, much more modest goals than HoloLens does. This is exactly why HoloLens might be able to succeed where Glass fails. Microsoft is not trying to build a product that will be attached to your face constantly in an attempt to replace your phone; they are trying to replace (or augment) the computer monitor, and it's about time.

The HoloLens can become a tool to use when I need or want it, but not something that is constantly begging me to talk to/touch it. For that, I still have my phone.

This is by far the most exciting wearable tech that has been announced. (Apple Watch? Plzzzzzz let me just download the WatchFace HoloLens app that that completely covers your face with a watch every time I look at you.) I really hope Microsoft nails it.
