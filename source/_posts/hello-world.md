## Create a new post

``` bash
$ hexo new "The hell do I write about now?"
```

Starting a new blog is kind of a huge pain. I've just spent an hour or two learning about and setting up yet another blog framework. It took another hour to search through hundreds of themes until I found the perfect mix of hip and minimal.

Now, 2-3 hours after I had a _~~great~~ idea_ for a blog post I am expected to fill in this generic First Post with some non-generic content that is going to be interesting enough for someone to find and read?

Nah, that's not happening. Not today.

Today I'm writing about how no one will read this blog because the Internet is saturated with enough great material to last a lifetime (e.g., [/r/TodayILearned](http://www.reddit.com/r/TodayILearned)).

I'm also writing about how this is likely to be one of the last blog posts that ever gets written here. (I'll be in good company; according to [bomus.org](http://www.bomus.org) apparently 94% of all blogs are abandoned after 1 post.)

That's ok though! For as long as I have something to say I'm going to say it dammit! It doesn't matter if no one reads it, and it doesn't matter if I run out of things to say by 9PM tonight. At some point I'll come back and be my own reader. For now, I'm just going to put it out there _on the line_.
