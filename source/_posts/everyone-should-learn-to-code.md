I could not be happier that [cursive is being dropped](http://www.eonline.com/news/481596/cursive-handwriting-will-no-longer-be-taught-in-schools-because-it-s-a-big-old-waste-of-time) and [programming is being picked up](http://hourofcode.com/us) in elementary schools. Children should stop learning how to use pens and pencils entirely as far as I'm concerned. (I wasn't exposed to programming until I was 21, and I am still kind of bitter about it).

I think about how much time I wasted in high school not learning software or web development and kick myself that I didn't get a headstart on this thing that I love to do. What a wizard I would be now if I had just put my stupid high school brain to productive use!

I feel this way because I absolutely <i>could have</i> learned how to program back then! With a little patience, the Internet, and a few minutes everyday (roughly), I could have become a developer and started creating my million-dollar app or website or video game.

Now, some people don't feel that they have a few minutes time to spare to learn something new. I'm convinced that in almost all cases those people are lying to themselves. If you watch any TV show on a regular basis at all then you have time to learn something new. Put your show on, crack open that laptop and learn how to multitask dammit! (Unless of course you're watching [Game of Thrones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8cEctQZpnI), in which case you should give your full and undivided attention to the television).

I have chosen computer programming as my career, so it seems obvious that I should learn development. But I feel very strongly that <b>everyone should and can learn how to write code</b>.

People have a bad perception of what it means to be a programmer. They think it's hard. They think there is a lot of math involved. They think it's nerds-only territory. They think it's all 1s and 0s. They think they won't get it.

They need to see programming as I see it: pure creation. It's easy, it's (relatively) math-free, it's open to everyone, and it's so much more expansive than just a 1 or a 0. <i>Writing code is about molding raw electricity that runs through a computer's circuits into a new creation that you dream up</i>.

The truth is, hopefully in 20 or 30 years the career of being a computer programmer will be phased out of our society entirely. Instead we'll have doctors who grew up learning how to write code the same time they were learning their ABCs. They'll be doing doctor stuff one day ([making people wait in little rooms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8upe9t3XO_0), writing illegibly on small pieces of paper, etc.) and realize there's a much better way for their robot assistant to do an open-heart surgery and they'll write a program to do it! This is why it's so important and exciting that everyone, including our children, is learning how to be a computer programmer.

The only expensive input to the process of creating a new app or website is your time to learn and do it. And you learn it by doing it. So if you have a "great idea", the right thing to do is to start making it a great reality.
