The question to think about is why does iPhone destroy Windows phone in the market? There are a number of reasons, but price, hardware, and UI aren't main factors in my opinion. The ultimate reason, if you trace it back, is the availability of apps. <sub><sup>Which, interestingly, is part of the reason Microsoft made a killing in the 90s over Mac computers.</sup></sub>

Apple moved before Microsoft to the smart phone market. Lots of people bought iPhones. Developers want to sell apps to lots of people. Lots of developers developed lots of apps for iPhone. Other people want more apps on their phone. Other people buy iPhones. More developers develop apps. Etc, etc, etc.

Microsoft needs this to take off in a big way to attract developers, because without fancy apps that do stuff like in the video above, people will look at HoloLens and see nothing but a clunky piece of useless hardware. If Microsoft tries to go the Google Glass route of selling a high priced product to a niche few, then the product will fail completely because it won't be worth buying at all.

Here are three things that Microsoft needs to get right about the HoloLens to get the buyer->developer->buyer cycle kickstarted.

<h3>Price</h3>

Price is going to be an important factor when Microsoft releases the HoloLens, and one that they are likely to get wrong. Microsoft is going to price this based on the fact that it <i>is</i> a PC wrapped up in some really expensive hardware. Unfortunately, people won't see it as a PC, they'll see it as an accessory.

If people don't buy it, developers won't create apps for it. If developers don't create apps for it, well then I have even less of a reason to fork over mad cash for it.

The one benefit Microsoft has is that Google was intentionally pricing Google Glass at the outrageous $2000 (instead of the $60 they buy the parts for). Microsoft just needs to remember that they need more than the tech geeks to pick this up for it to be a success.

A high price will also exclude your at-home programmers that just want to buy one to tinker with it, such as myself. This will lead to fewer apps, which leads to less incentive to buy.

<h3>Developer Support and API</h3>

This thing should be dead simple to write apps on. Now obviously there will be aspects of it that might be difficult, but to the furthest degree possible Microsoft needs to make the learning curve on writing sexy, useful apps as small as possible. HoloLens will go no where without developer support.

The device runs Windows 10 and therefore will support any app built on that platform. That being said, I as a future owner of a HoloLens did not spend $xxxx to be able to put a holographic screen of Angry Birds on my wall. I want to launch Angry Birds across the room and knock virtual crap off my piano. This. This is the piece they must make easy and accessible to all.

<h3>Device Integration</h3>

Remember the old days when you would plug a new printer in to your desktop and have to put in a CD to install a driver? <i>That is such BS</i>. Users need to be able to login to their HoloLens one time with their Microsoft Account and have everything they need or want from other devices synced up automatically. I don't ever want to have to Google `hololens driver download`.

The woman in the video seems to be working on a desktop PC while simultaneously viewing the file from her HoloLens. She then seamlessly starts editing it from her HoloLens. They nailed the concept, and it needs to be the reality. I really don't want to spend 30 minutes uploading and downloading files between my desktop and HoloLens every time I want to see something I'm working on take shape in the real world.


<i>Note: When I say there needs to be a lot of apps, it goes without saying that I mean [high quality apps](http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/5-reasons-why-the-windows-8-store-is-a-complete-mess/).</i>
