Artificial Intelligence has made some big splashes in the media lately. People's interest tends to be peaked when you have geniuses like [Elon Musk saying we are "summoning the demon"](http://www.cnet.com/news/elon-musk-we-are-summoning-the-demon-with-artificial-intelligence/) with our pursuit of AI. Musk makes it sound like right now at this very moment there is some laboratory in the depths of Silicon Valley with a bunch of nerds [sacrificing old computers](http://images.pushsquare.com/news/2013/05/suspected_playstation_network_hacker_takes_a_hammer_to_his_computers/attachment/0/original.jpg) in an attempt to raise iFrankenstein. It probably is not this dramatic... (not yet at least, give it another 10 - 15 years).

Many of our best minds are in fact concerned about AI. Elon Musk, [Stephen Hawking](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30290540), [Bill Gates](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/01/28/bill-gates-on-dangers-of-artificial-intelligence-dont-understand-why-some-people-are-not-concerned/), [John Connor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0xjc_OSJms), etc. It's easy to watch <i>The Terminator</i> or <i>The Matrix</i>, see how clearly fictitious these stories are, and then subsequently write-off any concern that something like that could actually happen the same way you write off <i>The Day After Tomorrow</i>. (Besides, if it does Neo will just save us all anyway amirite).

But how could our best and brightest actually believe in these fairytales?

<b>Well, these dissident voices are absolutely right</b>. The truth is that AI will completely destroy our world. The day a machine is as smart and sentient as a human without any of the biologically limitations is the beginning of the end for our society.

Now, it is certainly possible that the machines will destroy or enslave humanity in some sort of an attempt to balance an equation or divide by zero or solve for x or some stupid computer-y thing like that, but I have faith that the scientists doing the computer sacrifices 10 years from now will figure out a way to summon the demon without any of the demon-like qualities.

(i.e., try this:)
```java
if(self.feelsLikeDestroyingHumanity){
  return;
}
```

Instead, the machines will just be better than us at doing every single thing that needs to be done.

Oh you work on an assembly line for Foxconn making processors for iPhones? Sorry, [Tron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3ODe9mqoDE) spits processors out of his mouth and can work all day everyday. He's also a helluva lot cheaper because he was designed and manufactured by his brother Clu that we bought two years ago.

Not you though. You're a janitor at the local elementary school and the kids love you. Oh shoot though, we just got a brand new [Agent Smith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fosG7tmWTZ8). He cleans the school, teaches the students, is an interactive jungle gym, and coaches PE, which noone has known how to do for years. The kids love him because he knows them all individually by name and he sounds badass.

Don't worry, I'm sure your position as an accountant is safe and sou--damn, the new [TI-83 Calculator](http://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/939470//bmmg/books/Ti-83-Plus-Graphing-Calculator-for-Dummies-Paperback-L9780764549700.JPG) from Texas Instruments just read the new IRS tax codes before I could finish that sentence. Also, she doesn't make mistakes. Ever.

Surely we can't have cold, machine-like salesman. Sales requires passion and emotion and an ability to read people. Or maybe it just takes the new [Terminator](http://www.cinemablend.com/images/news_img/68511/Terminator_Genisys_68511.jpg) from Skynet! This new, charming, attractive, silver-foxed life-form proxy is sure to impress. He'll terminate your customers' problems in the blink of an eye! And if they need anything else, <i>he'll be back</i>! Literally any time of the day. For literally no commission. Yeah... You don't stand a chance.

President--we must have a human president because human's are better at weighing decisions and making tough choices. Bahahah, please I can't even get through that one seriously! If we still have a human president after AI becomes prolific in our society then his entire job will consist of being the one guy that remembers to turn on our Supreme Overlord every morning so that it can make sure everything keeps whirring and spinning. (Even this of course is satire as the Supreme Overlord could never be turned off).

Hopefully the power never goes out. We will be completely screwed.

There is only one job that MIGHT be safe from the machines: parenting. Even this is iffy, but creating a family will be more or less the only important thing humans are capable of doing anymore.

No one will know what to do with themselves to "make a living" yet we will have an abundance of all of the things we could ever want. Capitalism stops making sense in this scenario. The robots are happy to fulfill our needs (see below for how this works), and we'll have to learn to be happy having our needs fulfilled. One thing is for certain though, our society will be destroyed.

```java
if(self.feelsLazy){
  //Sleep for 2000 milliseconds
  Thread.sleep(2000);
  //Good to go
}

buildOneBillioniPhones();
```

One hundred years from now we might look back at Elon Musk's concerns about Artificial Intelligence and laugh. Perhaps we'll understand that the intelligence that makes up the human brain impossible to reproduce in any other way than birthing a human being. We'll think of how [Isaac Newton was a genius in defining the Laws of Physics, and yet an utter fool who spent a good deal of time studying alchemy in an attempt to turn lead into gold](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton%27s_occult_studies).

In the meantime, however, if we aren't comfortable with destroying our society completely then "summoning the demon" is something worth considering as we cautiously step forward towards [the Singularity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity).
