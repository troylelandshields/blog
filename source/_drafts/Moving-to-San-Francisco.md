title: Moving to San Francisco

After living in Provo since 2007 (with a small 2 year stint to live in Albania), Lindsay and I are venturing from this tiny town to San Francisco. This is kind of a dream of ours. We've always wanted to live in a big city and both of us have been offered great jobs which means we might be able to afford the rent we're going to have to pay.

Moving in general is pretty stressful, but moving to San Francisco has got to be the most stressful of all. My new employer put it pretty simply when he offered me the job and said, "I'm surprised you wanted to move here." That's what you want to hear.
